# UAV-Confrontation-using-H-MARL
This repo is related to UAV Confrontation using Heirarchial MultiAgent Reinforcement Learning
# Look at A* and other algorithms

# Make it a bidriectional project..
<ol>
  <li>Cooperative Env -->  Form clustering, try out A2C type architecture</li>
  <li>Confronatation env -->  Use competitive RL, H-MADDPG as found in paper</li>
</ol>
